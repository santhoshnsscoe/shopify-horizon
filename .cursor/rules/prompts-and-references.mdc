# Prompts and References

The prompts and references directories contain documentation and guides for AI agents to follow when working on various tasks in the Horizon theme.

## Living Documents

**Important**: All files in the `.cursor/prompts/` and `.cursor/references/` folders are living documents. This means:

- They should be updated as new cases are encountered
- When you discover a useful pattern, edge case, or solution while working on an issue, update the relevant file
- If something in these files doesn't work as expected, fix it immediately
- Add examples from real implementation experiences
- Remove or update outdated information

**CRITICAL ACTION REQUIREMENT**: When you encounter any pattern, issue, or solution while working - immediately update the relevant documentation file WITHOUT being asked. This includes:
- Code patterns to avoid (like console.log in tests)
- Better ways to accomplish tasks
- Edge cases or pitfalls discovered
- Clarifications for ambiguous instructions
- New tools or commands that work better

Do not wait for the user to suggest documentation updates. Proactively maintaining these living documents is part of completing any task.

## Purpose

These documentation files serve as:
- Step-by-step guides for common tasks
- Documentation of best practices learned from experience
- References for handling edge cases and pitfalls
- Templates for consistent workflows

## Usage

When an AI agent is asked to perform a task that has corresponding documentation:
1. The agent should follow the documented steps
2. If the steps need adjustment based on the specific situation, the agent should note what changes were needed
3. **MANDATORY**: Update the documentation immediately with any new learnings, patterns, or pitfalls discovered during the task - do not wait to be asked

## Examples of Living Document Updates

- Adding a new pitfall discovered during implementation
- Clarifying a step that was ambiguous
- Adding a reference to a newly created documentation file
- Updating commands or scripts that have changed
- Adding examples of good vs bad practices
