Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, sell and/or create derivative works of the Software or any part thereof, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

The rights granted above may only be exercised to develop themes that integrate or interoperate with Shopify software or services. All other uses of the Software are strictly prohibited.

For the avoidance of doubt, you may not submit, list, market, sell, distribute, or otherwise make available any theme that is based on, derived from, or incorporates any portion of the Software (a “Derived Theme”) via the Shopify Theme Store, any other Shopify-operated channel, or any off-platform channel (including your own website or third-party marketplaces). Shopify may determine, in its sole discretion, whether a theme is a Derived Theme for purposes of this restriction. You may not circumvent this restriction by making insubstantial changes, reformatting or reorganizing code, or by otherwise claiming independent creation.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may deliver a Derived Theme directly to merchants as part of services engagements, solely for those merchants’ own use in their Shopify stores. Any such delivery may not be marketed or offered as a general-purpose product, and the Derived Theme may not be resold, relicensed, or redistributed by you or the merchant.

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.
